# Welcome to `b-package`

## About

The `b-package` project has the function of documenting programming language packages created by [Bruno Faria](https://brunofariadf.github.io/). Considering that the goal is to create simple packages for long-term code maintenance, then a simplified page that gathers all the documentation is appropriate.
